1,1kps,1000 Pitches Summit,,"The 1000 Pitches Summit was started for the first time last year upon the conclusion of the 1000 Pitches Competition. Erik Torenberg was the inaugural project director. He saw a need to harvest the energy and entrepreneurial buzz created during the pitching competition and do something with it. Many students are given a taste of the entrepreneurial world in the competition, but they are still in the dark about what it actually means to take an idea to the next step. The purpose of the Summit is to give the students in the top 200 pitches an opportunity to learn how to further develop their ideas and possibly turn them into a business.",Doug Neal's blog post following the first 1000 Pitches Summit in December of 2011: http://cfe.umich.edu/directorblog/?p=408 ,none,"In the future, we plan to find a way to foster the most energy and passion for entrepreneurship as possible and then take that momentum and do something with it. As of now, the Summit gets students excited to do more with their ideas. We plan to try and get students to actually take that next step."

3,tkp,The Kenya Project,We bring students to Kenya to their passions into positive social impact through startup experience and intercultural awareness while supporting Kenyan entrepreneurship.,"It began with one student and one idea.  When I was a freshman, I saw that UM lacked a program focused on social impact through undergraduate entrepreneurship.  Students had little chance to apply the knowledge and ideas they began forming in their classes to make real world change.  I sought to change that through The Kenya Project: an entrepreneurship immersion program for 3 weeks in Kenya over the summer. It's all about collaboration and creating a springboard for creativity by mixing Kenyan minds and UM minds.  Both sides bring ideas for economic improvement, global change, and a better life and that combination leads to innovation.  We are all about the power and passion of students to reach out across thousands of miles of ocean, land, history, and culture to touch lives and leave an imprint.","Last year

4,edu,EDUpreneurship Bootcamp,EDUpreneurship bootcamp is a three-week initiative from February to March at University of Michigan that provides opportunity for students to generate the next game-changing ideas for education.,"EDUpreneurship started out with an individual who was sick of hearing a lot of talk, but no action. Andrew Schantz, our first project director, took the first step beyond nice conversations floating around about bridging the gap between education & entrepreneurship and took action to plan the inaugural EDUpreneurship Summit this past winter term. Now, with a dynamic team, EDUpreneurship is taking the next step towards generating most innovative ideas for education.","Within 72 hours, 50 undergrad and grad students, 7 speakers, 10 mentors (professors, ED-entrepreneurs), and 5 judges (school administrators, entrepreneurs, investors) came together to work towards a common vision for fresh, new ideas for education.",edu.jpg,EDUpreneurship hopes to be the premiere education idea incubator in our community & across America to generate the next-big ideas for education.

6,crashcourse,Startup Crash Course,"Empowering student-entrepreneurs through education, we run a series of crash courses, equipping students with essential startup-related skills that could be the launchpad for the next great thing.  ","In late 2011, we noticed that there was a pretty big missing piece of the puzzle for promoting entrepreneurship on campus.  Student interest in entrepreneurship around campus had been kindled and continued to grow, yet the educational opportunities surrounding their new-found interest did not scale as quickly.  

To fill this void, we created Startup Crash Course, where we aim to put on crash courses that bring together a group of ambitious students who want to take it upon themselves to expand their startup skillset.  We provide the workshop-style, interactive crash courses to catalyze the community, and they build upon that foundation, whether it's on topics like fundraising for their early startup idea or, our most popular crash course, iOS Development.  ","In Winter of 2012, we had our first crash course.  In under 24 hours, we broke 100 signups for the iOS crash course that would kick off the semester.  Since then, we have had 3 other crash courses, and even surpassed 100 attendees in one of them, as we improvised to make the course scale to accommodate everyone.  In this latest crash course, we even had alumni attend!",crash_course.png,"The future is to continue discovering what topics people are missing to take themselves to the next level with regards to startups and entrepreneurship.  We aim to build a strong community that continues learning after the crash course, using it simply as a foundation and launchpad for further pursuits.  

Next semester, we will be looking to have a huge Startup Crash Course full-day workshop, where students can come to a 1-stop shop and choose small, interactive crash courses to participate in throughout the day.  We hope that students will leave the day having met fellow students interested in learning more outside of the classroom, and that they will have been equipped with a much larger range of basic startup skills and knowledge."

9,sociale,Social (E)mpact,"Social (E)mpact is a week long event that brings together community members, student organizations with a social mission, and student entrepreneurs to champion social change through entrepreneurship. ","We felt this pulse, this hunger, this desire for impact on our campus. There's an almost incomprehensible diversity of not only students, but also of student organizations, all with a deep conviction that they can create change. We developed Social (E)mpact to leverage that energy and funnel that into social enterprises.","Over the course of our week-long program, we brought over 150 people together, uniting the University of Michigan campus with the Detroit community. Students crossed disciplines and schools within Michigan to connect with each other.
