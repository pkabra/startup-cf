                	<li><h3>Is the MPowered Career Fair a company recruiting fair?</h3></li>
					<li>Yes, the MCF is a company recruiting fair consisting of mostly small, high-growth companies with opportunities for internships, co-ops and full-time employment for all majors (especially for engineering, business and science students) and for all undergraduate (freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors) and all graduate students.</li>

					<li><h3>What makes the MPowered Career Fair different from other career fairs?</h3></li>
					<li>The MCF is comprised of small high growth companies and student start ups from the Ann Arbor region. Unlike other career fairs you may have attended, at the MCF you will be talking to company CEOs and top executives. It is a wonderful opportunity to find an internship, fulltime job, or co-op position with a small firm, where you may take part in important decision making process that small firms have to make, or even work with executives and founders in a diverse array of industries.</li>

					<li><h3>How do I get to Central Campus from North Campus?</h3></li>
					<li><p>To go to North from Central:

                    Go to the bus stop behind the C.C. Little Building.
                    Take the Bursley/Baits bus. It should come every 15 minutes on slow days.
                    Get off at the bus stop in front of Pierpont Commons. The bus ride should be around ~8 minutes. Don't be afraid to ask where Pierpont Commons is.
                    Once you get off the bus, the building in front of you is Pierpont Commons.
                    To go to Central from North:
                    
                    Go out from the main entrance of Pierpont Commons.
                    Head towards the bus stop across Murfin Rd.
                    Take any bus [Bursley-Baits, Northwood, etc.]. It will lead you to Central Campus [C.C. Little Bus Stop]. A map is available here.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>How many companies attended last year's MCF and how many are planning to attend this year's MCF?</h3></li>
                    <li>Over 100 companies attended last year's MCF and we expect more to attend this year.</li>
                    
                    <li><h3>Do seniors and graduate students have opportunities to get jobs through this event?</h3></li>
                    <li>Seniors and graduates are highly encouraged to attend the MCF. There was high demand for them from companies last year. Companies are even hungrier this year.</li>
                    
                    <li><h3>Do freshmen have opportunities to get internships through this event?</h3></li>
                    <li>Of course! Based on last year’s MCF report data, a number of freshmen had been hired.</li>
                    
                    <li><h3>What is the dress code for the interviews and fair?</h3></li>
                    <li>There is no specified dress code. During last year’s MCF, the majority of students’ attire ranged between formal (suit) to smart casual (jeans and a collared shirt). Many of the interviewers themselves were not dressed formally. It is up to you on what impression you want to give your potential employers.</li>
                    
                    <li><h3>If I'm not an engineering or business student, would I find an internship or job?</h3></li>
                    <li>At last year's fair, many non-engineering and non-business students received offers for jobs and internships. However, we advise that you look through the company profiles and see what kinds of positions they are offering. This will give you a good picture of whether or not you fit in what they might be looking for.</li>
